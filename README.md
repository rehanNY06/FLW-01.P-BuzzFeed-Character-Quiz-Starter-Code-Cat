# FLW 01.P Code Nation's Buzzfeed Quiz! [Light]

## Project Description
Using JavaScript skills, you will build a quiz app that will determine what you want! Could be a character quiz, which tech company are you quiz, or this is the type of cheese you are quiz! 

You'll need to have a way to provide the user's different results based on their specific input. 

If two users input the same answers, they should receive the same result.

Make sure to check off your items as you complete them. [ ] → [x]

## Planning
- [ ] Review your Starter Code and make sure you understand what code has already been written for you.

## Set-Up
- [ ] Fork your own copy of the repl.
- [ ] Double-check that you are signed in with your GitHub account.

## HTML
1. [ ] Update the header for quiz with your planned idea 😊
2. [ ] Update the cover photo with one that makes sense.
3. [ ] Update the questions for your quiz. Be sure to have AT LEAST three to ask the user. Add more questions if you want!

## JS

### Variables
4. [x] Declare variables for the html elements you'll use as selectors later. You'll need one for the:
    - [x] submit button
    - [x] the div where the result will display
    - [x] first question input
    - [x] second question input
    - [x] third question input
</br>
</br>

5. Next, we need to declare variables for values we'll set later. You'll need one for:
    - [ ] an image source
    - [ ] a result
    - [ ] a score for question 1
    - [ ] a score for question 2
    - [ ] a score for question 3

### Variables inside the .onlick event

6. [ ] Declare user input variables for each of your questions. If you have three questions, you should have three variables. These variables should equal the value of the user input for each question.
    - If you don't want to stress on whether or not the user's capitalization is exact, consider using the .toLowerCase() method.
</br>
</br>

### Conditionals
7. [ ] Create a conditional statement for the responses to Question 1 based on the user input.
</br>

8. [ ] Create a conditional statement for the responses to Question 2 based on the user input.
</br>

9. [ ] Create a conditional statement for the responses to Question 3 based on the user input.

<em><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure each condition results in the question score variables (you declared earlier without a value) being assigned a numeric value!</em>

10. [ ] Declare a variable for the total score of the quiz and set it equal to the sum of each question score.
</br>

11. [ ] Create a conditional statement for the result to the quiz based on the total score. Using string interpolation, display these to the page:
      - the result
      - an image that corresponds
      - a message to go with it.

<em><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure each condition results in the result and image source variables (you declared earlier without a value) being assigned a value! 

The image source should be one that corresponds to the result. Say the result is "SpongeBob SquarePants". Then the image source should be an image address to a SpongeBob image.</em>

<em><strong>What this could look like:</strong></em>
![Example of result div.](/images/image.png)
